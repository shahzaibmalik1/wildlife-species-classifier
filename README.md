# Image Classification Problem

Welcome to the GitHub page for the final project of the Applied AI course! In this project, we focused on image classification using three Kaggle datasets. We experimented with three popular CNN architectures: ResNet18, ShuffleNet V2, and MobileNet V2, for each dataset.

The repository includes three IPython notebook files, each corresponding to one dataset and architecture. These notebooks contain the code for data processing and model training for each specific combination of dataset and architecture.

Additionally, we have provided a zip file containing all the result graphs generated during the project for easy reference. Furthermore the video of the presentation, Final Report of the project and the presentation slides are attached in this repository.

Feel free to explore the code and results, and experiment with different hyperparameters, data preprocessing techniques, and model architectures. We hope this repository serves as a valuable resource for your image classification projects. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out. 

Happy coding!
